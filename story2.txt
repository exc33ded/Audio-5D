Chapter One: The Haunted Forest

Rain poured as Alex and Mira entered the ancient forest. Thunder rumbled above, and the wind howled through the twisted trees. Suddenly, a distant river could be heard, its waters rushing over rocks.

A heavy wooden gate creaked open, startling them. "Did you hear that?" Mira whispered, her voice trembling.

From the shadows, a beast roared, echoing through the trees. Alex drew his sword, ready for battle as the storm intensified.

In the chaos, a fire crackled nearby, offering a brief moment of warmth. But soon, the sound of a crowd chanting in the distance drew them deeper into the unknown.

Would they survive the night, or would the haunted forest claim two more souls?
